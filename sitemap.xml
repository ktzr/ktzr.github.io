            <image:title>First Attempt, Reflections of Calm</image:title>
            <image:caption>After attending Arts and Crafts society at Glasgow University I decided to give painting a
                go.
                I followed along to Bob Ross painting Reflections of Calm.
                The only times I had tried up to this point were during primary school, and much later when my
                friend convinced me to attend Arts and Crafts society. We made Christmas cards.

            <image:title>Trying Out Oil, Delightful Meadow Home</image:title>
            <image:caption>As I had so much fun doing my first paintings, I decided to upgrade from the acrylic paints
                and
                printer paper I used.
                So I borrowed some oil paints and paper and followed Bob Ross painting Delightful Meadow Home.
                I liked how it was without the shed so decided to stop a bit early

            <image:title>Time To Buy Supplies, Evening's Glow</image:title>
            <image:caption>As I had so much fun doing my first two painting I decided i would finally bite the bullet
                and buy
                some art supplies.
                That weekend I headed to my local art shop and got myself a set of paintbrushes, some oil paints and
                paper to match.
                When I got home, as always, I put on Bob Ross and painted along to Evening's Glow.
                I got a bit carried away with the hills and just kept going.

            <image:title>Going Solo, Tree By A Lake</image:title>
            <image:caption>I felt it was finally time to paint something without any guidance.
                So I left Bob Ross behind, gathered up my art supplies and just went for it.
                Lacking some confidence I decided to paint on a smaller peace of paper.
                After a mix of painting and panicking, I ended up with "Tree By A Lake".

            <image:caption>These are some flowers I saw whilst walking through Kelvingrove park.
                I thought they looked pretty so I took a picture.
