  title: My First Attempt
  description: After attending Arts and Crafts society at Glasgow University I decided to give painting a go.
                      I followed along to Bob Ross painting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJFB6rH3z2A">Reflections of Calm</a>.
                      The only times I had tried up to this point were during primary school, and much later when my friend convinced me to attend Arts and Crafts society.
                      We made Christmas cards.

  title: Trying Out Oil
  description: As I had so much fun doing my first paintings, I decided to upgrade from the acrylic paints and printer paper I used.
                So I borrowed some oil paints and paper and followed Bob Ross painting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWoInh2USOs">Delightful Meadow Home</a>.
                I liked how it was without the shed so decided to stop a bit early.

  title: Time To Buy Supplies
  description: As I had so much fun doing my first two painting I decided i would finally bite the bullet and buy some art supplies.
                That weekend I headed to my local art shop and got myself a set of paintbrushes, some oil paints and paper to match.
                When I got home, as always, I put on Bob Ross and painted along to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTEKGOi6SVg">Evening's Glow</a>.
                I got a bit carried away with the hills and just kept going.

  title: Going Solo
  description: I felt it was finally time to paint something without any guidance.
                So I left Bob Ross behind, gathered up my art supplies and just went for it.
                Lacking some confidence I decided to paint on a smaller peice of paper.
                After a mix of painting and panicking, I ended up with "Tree By A Lake".
