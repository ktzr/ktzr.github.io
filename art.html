                <h3>My First Attempt</h3>
                <p>After attending Arts and Crafts society at Glasgow university I decided to give paingint ago.
                    I followed along to Bob Ross painting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJFB6rH3z2A">Reflections
                        of Calm</a>.
                    The only times i had tried at up to this point was during primary school and much later when my
                    friend convinced me to attend Arts and Crafts society, we made christmas cards. </p>

                <h3>Trying Out Oil</h3>
                <p>As I had so much fun doing my first painting I decided to upgrade from the acrylic paints and printer
                    paper I used for my first paining.
                    So i borrowed some of Oil paints and paper and followed Bob Ross painting <a

                    I liked how it was without the shed so decided to stop a bit early.</p>

                <h3>Time To Buy Supplies</h3>
                <p>As I had so much fun doing my first two painting I decided i would finaly bite the bullet and buy
                    some art supplies.
                    That weekend I headed to my local art shop and got myself a set of paintbrushes, some oil paints and
                    paper to match.
                    When I got home, as always, I put on Bob Ross and painted along too <a

                    I got a bit carried away with the hills and just kept going.</p>
